* autocode:
  * LLM are unwieldy with only CPU.
* dopamine:
  * there is not much utilit in deconnstructing poor quality models.
  * it is easy to get distracted by evident properties of the input.
* bridge dims
  * code no longr works.
    * apparent OOM in execution of jax compiled update fn.

posssible futures:
  * construct + use lens with human guidance.
    * need a comprehensible KG.
      * ? construct introspection KG concerning state of demo.
      * ? adopt an existing topical KG of modest size.
        * ? wikipedia category.
      * ? bridge example
        * requires domain expertise to comprehend
      * ? COBOL example:
        * https://github.com/seshu1999/STUDENT-LOAN-DETAILS is solely docx files.
    * to form lenses:
      * identify a pattern
      * ...
    * use the lenses to inform decision(s).

cobol2rust
* understand the target language and available libraries ("crates")
  * iteratively expand a KG correlating:
    * language features
    * crate functionality
    * design patterns.
  * summarize tha KG with decision-tree lenses isolating
    relevant knowledge for a given source construct
  * train neural nets to recognize answers to space-dividing questions.
    * in particular:
      * does this source fragment duplicate available functionality?
      * ...
